  üîç Troubleshooting Summary

  I've identified 3 critical issues preventing the block library from using JSON files:

  Root Causes:

  1. ‚ùå No Electron IPC Handlers: The main process has ZERO IPC handlers registered. When ElectronBlockService
  calls ipc.invoke('block-library:get-all'), nothing responds.
  2. ‚ùå Hardcoded Redux Store: packages/web_app/src/store/types.ts:31 initializes with only 3 blocks:
  libraryBlocks: [Constant, Sum, Multiply]  // Hardcoded from DefaultBlocks
  3. ‚ùå Missing BlockManager: There's no server-side block management in the Electron main process to read JSON
  files from disk.

  Why You Only See 3 Blocks:

  The web app never actually calls the BlockService successfully because:
  - IPC calls fail silently (no handlers)
  - Redux store uses hardcoded blocks from DefaultBlocks
  - JSON files exist but are never loaded

  Can We Delete DefaultBlocks?

  Not yet! Current dependencies:
  - ‚úÖ packages/web_app/src/store/types.ts:1 - Active import
  - ‚úÖ Redux initialization - Uses Constant, Sum, Multiply

  Safe to delete after:
  1. Implementing Electron BlockManager
  2. Registering IPC handlers
  3. Updating Redux to load from service
  4. Verifying tests pass

  Implementation Required:

‚è∫ I've created a comprehensive troubleshooting report at claudedocs/TROUBLESHOOTING_BLOCK_LIBRARY.md with:

  ‚úÖ Root cause analysis with evidence‚úÖ Architecture gap diagrams showing what's missing‚úÖ Complete 
  implementation plan with file locations‚úÖ Deletion safety checklist‚úÖ Testing verification steps

  Next Steps: Would you like me to:
  1. Implement the Electron BlockManager and IPC handlers?
  2. Update the Redux store to use the BlockService?
  3. Both of the above to complete the integration?

  The implementation will enable the JSON-based block system and allow safe deletion of the DefaultBlocks
  directory.
