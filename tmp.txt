  ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

  For production deployment, consider implementing:
  1. A proper preload script with IPC communication
  2. Re-enable contextIsolation: true
  3. Implement a secure CSP: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' (if needed for React)

  But for development and testing, the current configuration will work perfectly with Electron 38.
